TODO
----
* Design better graphics! 
	* Replace charging bar
	* Replace character
	* Replace background
	* Replace projectile
	* Make a logo! 
* Make rewind effect draw an onion-skin effect
* Rewinding: Make rewind accelerate as the effect lengthens
* Collision detection
* Cooldown implementation for ability
	* Countdown/white overlay filling to indicate cooldown
* Main menu
* Difficulty settings
	* Harder = Faster + more projectiles, increased cooldown of ability
* Other powerups/abilities
* Sound - use royalty free clips? 
* Possibly combine timerWorld and timerRewind and set options to differentiate
* Make character flash/fade out and in when using ability
	* Fade out when charging, flash back in when finished
